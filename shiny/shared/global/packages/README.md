### Global R package dependencies

Files in _global/packages_ declare R packages 
that are used by one or more apps in a suite. They are read by 
MDI::install() to discover the R packages to install.

### Component R package dependencies

Any app, module, or other component can also declare its need
for a specific R package in its _module.yml_ or _config.yml_ file
(there is no harm in relisting a package already listed 
elsewhere - it will only be installed once):

```yml
packages: 
   R:  
    - xxx
    - yyy
   Bioconductor: null
```

### Installing vs. attaching

Packages declared in a tool suite are _installed_ but are never _attached_ 
using the <code>library()</code> function. Thus, you must either:

- call functions in full syntax, e.g., <code>package::function()</code> (**preferred**)
- call <code>library(package)</code> yourself (**discouraged**, you could break the framework)

In contrast, packages listed in the 'mdi-apps-framework' repository are attached and 
their functions can be called directly, e.g., Shiny's <code>observeEvent()</code>.
