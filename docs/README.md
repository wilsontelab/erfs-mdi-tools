The **docs** folder contains markdown files, in addition to those
found in other folders, that are used in the GitHub pages documentation
site for the mdi-suite-template repository.

Developers should swap these out, or simply delete them,
as you build a documentation site for your tool suite. 

Follow the front matter patterns in the template's files to help you get going.
