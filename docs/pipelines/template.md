## {{page.title}}

Folder _pipelines/_template_ has a working boilerplate for
a basic Stage 1 pipeline. 

Copy it to begin work on a new pipeline. At a minimum, you will
want to read and edit file _pipeline.yml_ and add code into
an action subfolder.

Create file _docs/pipelines/PIPELINE_NAME.md_ to document your new pipeline.
Suggested sections to include would be an overview of its purpose,
prerequisites, etc.
