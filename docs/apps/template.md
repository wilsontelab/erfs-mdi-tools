## {{page.title}}

Folder _shiny/apps/\_template_ has a working boilerplate for
a basic Stage 2 app. 

Copy it to begin work on a new app. At a minimum, you will
want to read and edit files:

- config.yml
- overview.md

Create file _docs/apps/APP\_NAME.md_ to document your new app.
Suggested sections to include would be an overview of its purpose,
prerequisites, etc.
