# The same container is used to execute all actions in a pipeline. If different 
# containers are required for different actions, they must be in different pipelines.

# initialize the container base, typically a Linux image pulled from Docker Hub
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:20.04
Stage: build
# alternatively, update a previous major.minor version of this pipeline's container:
# Bootstrap: oras
# From: ghcr.io/GIT_USER/SUITE_NAME/PIPELINE_NAME:v0.0
# Stage: build

# install system-level requirements such as libraries and common system utilities
# do not install specialized programs here (use conda definitions in pipeline.yml)
%post
    # apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    #     PACKAGE_NAME

# if desired, you may include additional definition file sections below, but be aware
# that common required definition sections will be appended by the pipelines framework
# usually, only the sections above need to be provided in this file

# avoid placing files into system-defined bind paths within the container,
# they will likely be overridden in a running container

# instead, add files to a system path such as /opt, /usr, /srv etc.
